####Summary
I am currently studying Electronic and Computer Engineering in Dublin City University. I am passionate about technology, fixing broken things and learning.
I find it easy to get on with people as shown with my experiences in Belvedere College and DCU.

####Experience
######Intern, <a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~pel">Performance Engineering Laboratory</a> <br>
######Dublin City University - Summer 2015<br>
Built a new <a href="https://github.com/AlbertFaust/webdev/tree/master/PerformanceEngineeringLaboratory">website</a> using HTML, CSS and Javascript with the Bootstrap framework under the supervision of <a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~munteang/">Dr. Gabriel Miro Muntean</a> for the Performance Engineering Laboratory.<br>
Improved the design and user experience of the site by restructuring the navigation and updating the outdated style using the *scrollspy.js* Bootstrap plugin and some Javascript. The new site is also responsive to different screen resoloutions unlike the old site.<br>

####Accomplishments/Interests
* Built my own PC.
* Comfortable with various Linux distributions.
* First Year Representative of Redbrick, DCUâ€™s Computer Networking society.
* Helped organise and participated in the Belvedere Sleep Out two times and also made the website for the event.
* Raised money for charity and participated in cycling the Camino de Santiago.
* My favourite subjects in the Leaving Cert were; Maths, Applied Maths and Physics.
* Really enjoy programming and electronics.
* Experience in C and currently working on learning Python in my spare time.
