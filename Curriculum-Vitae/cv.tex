\section{\textbf{Experience}}
\begin{tabular}{rl}	
\textsc{Summer} 2015 & \textbf{Intern, Performance Engineering Laboratory} - Dublin City University, Dublin.\\
& Built a new website using HTML, CSS and Javascript with the Bootstrap \\
& framework under the supervision of Dr. Gabriel Miro Muntean \\
& for the Performance Engineering Laboratory.
Improved the design and user \\
& experience of the site by restructuring the navigation and updating the \\
& outdated style using the scrollspy.js Bootstrap plugin and some Javascript. The \\
& new site is also responsive to different screen resoloutions unlike the old site.\\&\\

\textsc{Summer} 2015 & \textbf{Technician, Compliance Engineering Ireland} - Dunshaughlin , Meath.\\
& In CEI I was exposed to different types of EMC testing and learned a lot about them. \\
& I worked along side experienced engineers who were able to teach me how the \\
& products we were testing worked and to ensure they met the standards for each \\
& test. Some of the tests I performed include radio emissions, radio immunity, \\
& conduction emissions, static testing and radio tests. It allowed me to understand \\
& how electronics work in a practical setting and I gained huge insight into EMC.\\&\\

\textsc{February} 2012 & \textbf{Intern, Graffiti Design} - Fairview , Dublin.\\
& During my time in Graffiti Design I assisted in the backing up of their databases\\
& after a computer crash. It provided valuable technical experience and showed \\
& me how to work in a constantly changing environment that lacked usual\\
& business structure.\\&\\
